## Golden Rule of interpretation
When the plain sense of scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense;
therefore, take every word at its primary ordinary, usual literal meaning
unless the facts of the immediate context, studied in the light of related 
passages and axiomatic and fundamental truths indicate clearly otherwise.
