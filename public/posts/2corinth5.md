# Eyes for Eternity

## James 4:14: 
*"You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away."*

## Leader: 
The Pastor's sermon focused exclusively on Verse 10. This verse is closely tied to verses 1-9, serving as a conclusion and emphasizing the points made earlier. 

Read these verses to better illustrate the meaning of Verse 10.

### 2 Corinthians 5:1-10
1. *For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.*
2. *For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven*
3. *inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked.* 
4. *For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.* 
5. *Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.*
6. *Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—* 
7. *for we walk by faith, not by sight—*
8. *we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.* 
9. *Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.*
10. *For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.*

### Spirit as a pledge
**2 Corinthians 1:21-22**
*"Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God, who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge."*

**Ephesians 1:13-14**
*"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory."*

.

> ### Leader:
> - In the Ephesians verse did you notice what Pastor Pete was talking about at the baptism? and look at it closely, do you notice the process of salvation listed there?
> - What is the difference if any between inheritance and reward (recompense)
>
> **The concepts of "inheritance" and "rewards" in the New Testament, while related, have distinct meanings and implications for believers. Here's a breakdown with scriptural references:**
>
> ### Inheritance
> **Inheritance** in the New Testament generally refers to the eternal life and the kingdom of God that believers receive by virtue of being children of God through faith in Jesus Christ. It is something granted to believers by grace, not earned by works.
>
> 1. **Inheritance as Sons of God**:
>   - *Romans 8:16-17 (NASB1995)*: "The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him."
>   - *Galatians 4:7 (NASB1995)*: "Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God."
>
> 2. **Eternal Life as Inheritance**:
>   - *Titus 3:7 (NASB1995)*: "So that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life."
>   - *1 Peter 1:3-4 (NASB1995)*: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you."
>
> ### Rewards
> **Rewards** in the New Testament refer to what believers receive based on their faithfulness and works done in service to Christ during their earthly lives. Unlike the inheritance, which is a gift of grace, rewards are given in accordance with what a believer has done.
>
> 1. **Rewards for Faithfulness**:
>   - *1 Corinthians 3:8 (NASB1995)*: "Now he who plants and he who waters are one; but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor."
>   - *2 Corinthians 5:10 (NASB1995)*: "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad."
>
> 2. **Rewards in the Kingdom**:
>   - *Matthew 16:27 (NASB1995)*: "For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and WILL THEN REPAY EVERY MAN ACCORDING TO HIS DEEDS."
>   - *Revelation 22:12 (NASB1995)*: "Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done."
>
> ### Summary
> - **Inheritance** is about our position as God's children and the eternal life and kingdom we receive by grace through faith in Christ. It is not based on our works but on our relationship with God.
> - **Rewards** are given to believers based on their works and faithfulness in this life. These rewards are distinct from the inheritance and are distributed according to how we have served Christ.
