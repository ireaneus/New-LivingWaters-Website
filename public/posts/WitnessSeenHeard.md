**Read:** Acts 4, Luke 24:44-49

### Acts 4:20
*"for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard."*

In this passage, Peter said _"We cannot stop"_ speaking about what he has seen and heard. Not that He will try, or in disobedience to the Priests, but that he cannot, because God has commanded him to testify to what he has seen and heard.  If you don't believe me it is all over the NT of the Bible.  We are commanded to testify about what we have seen and heard.

Peter is referring to another section in Luke's gospel
### Luke 24:44-49
*44 Now He said to them, "These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things which are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."
45 Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
46 and He said to them, "Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,
47 and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
48 "You are witnesses of these things.
49 "And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high."*

Then He opened their minds to the Scriptures, and not many days later they were *"clothed with power from on high"*
Back in Acts 4:8 *"Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit,"* began to teach.

## Witness - what we have seen and heard
### Question: Regarding Jesus of Nazereth, the Messiah, Lamb of God, our Redeemer, your personal Lord and Savior; what are you witnesses of?
If you were in a court room and had to testify to your belief in Jesus as your redeemer what can you testify to what you have seen and heard about Him personally.
To put it plainly _"What am I a witness of?"_

I'm not asking of your personal testimony (although that can be part of it), or your assurance of salvation, my question here is more of a recent walk of faith you are having.
### Ask yourself "What am I a witness of? (Regarding my Savior, what can I testify to anyone about Him?)
To do this

1. First ask God to clothe you with His Spirit and let Him open your mind to the things which you have seen and heard about Himself in your life.

2. Think of how God has revealed Himself to you recently, it could be this past year, 6 months, this month etc.

3. Write them down, What you saw, what you heard and what you felt.

Spend today doing that, asking God how have you revealed yourself to me lately? 

If nothing comes to mind, maybe write down when you came to know Him, maybe a favorite verse and explain why, or a song, Hymn and why .  
- Writing down anything will only re-enforce your confidence in your belief in Him.
- Ask God daily to reveal Himself to you
- Look back at what you wrote and let it be your testamony, maybe keep a journal, or a private blog

## 2 Corinthians 10:7
*7 You are looking at things as they are outwardly . If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.*

## Hymn "I know Whom I have believed"
*"I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.*

*But "I know whom I have believed
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day."*
