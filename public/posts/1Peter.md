## Verses 1-2
**Verse 1:** 
*Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as strangers, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen* 

### **Peter, an Apostle**
>**Matt 16:15-19** *He said to them, “But who do you yourselves say that I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.”*
>
>**John 21:15-19** *Now when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?” He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Tend My lambs.” He said to him again, a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” He said to Him, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.” He said to him, “Shepherd My sheep.” He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?” Peter was hurt because He said to him the third time, “Do you love Me?” And he said to Him, “Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You." Jesus said to him, “Tend My sheep.*  
>
>*Truly, truly I tell you, when you were younger, you used to put on your belt and walk wherever you wanted; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will put your belt on you, and bring you where you do not want to go.” Now He said this, indicating by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had said this, He said to him, “Follow Me!”*


### **Foreigners, strangers, not of this world**
> **Heb 11:8-10** *By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he left, not knowing where he was going. By faith he lived as a stranger in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.*
>
> **Heb 11:13-16** *All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen and welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. And indeed if they had been thinking of that country which they left, they would have had opportunity to return. But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.*
>
> **JOHN 15:19** *If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.*
>
> **John 17:16** *They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world*
>
> **John 18:36** *Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm.”*
>
> **1 Pet. 2:11, James 1:1** *dispersed or the Dispersion*
>
> **DEUT. 7:6** *For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for His own possession out of all the peoples who are on the face of the earth.*

### **Encyclical letter**

This encyclical letter, which basically traveled from city to city to be read in each of them

> - Northern Asia (Present day Turkey)
>
> **Acts 2:9, 16:6-7** *Parthians, Medes, and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia. They passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, after being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia; they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;*

**Verse 2:** 
*according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you.*

- *May grace and peace be yours in fullest measure*
- *multiplied for you*

### **Foreknowledge of God the Father**
> **Rom 8:29** *For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters*
>
> **1 Pet. 1:20.** *For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you*
>
> **Eph 1:3-6** *Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, 4just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love 5He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will*
>
> 2 Thess 2:13, 1 Thess 1:4, Rom 11:2

This foreknowledge (as some would make you believe) is not God knowing beforehand, it is more of a predetermined, or pre-ordained knowledge of God

>**Acts 2:22-23** *“Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know— this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death.*

### **Sanctifying of the Spirit**
> **2 Thess 2:13** *But we should always give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth*

### **Sprinkled with His blood**
> **Heb 10:22, 12:24** *let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.  and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.*
>
> **Heb 9:13-14** *For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?*
>
> **Exo 24:6-8** *Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and the other half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it as the people listened; and they said, “All that the Lord has spoken we will do, and we will be obedient!” So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.”*

### **May grace and peace be multiplied to you.**
> **2 Pet.** *Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord*
> 
Both Peter and Paul greet the churches with the same greeting "Grace to you, and peace" 

> Grace = God's unmerited favor and blessing, In the context of the New Testament, it often denotes God's gracious gift of salvation and His continued favor and blessing on believers.

> Peace = In the New Testament, "eirēnē" often describes the peace that comes from God, reconciling believers to Himself through Christ and fostering harmonious relationships among His people.

**1. χάρις (charis)**:
   - **Meaning**: Grace, favor, kindness
   - **Context**: In the Greek language, "charis" conveys the idea of grace as goodwill and loving-kindness given by God or expressed in human relationships. It can refer to favor that one receives without any merit, emphasizing the unearned and generous nature of God's grace. In the context of the New Testament, it often denotes God's gracious gift of salvation and His continued favor and blessing on believers.

**2. εἰρήνη (eirēnē)**:
   - **Meaning**: Peace, harmony, tranquility
   - **Context**: "Eirēnē" in Greek signifies a state of peace, including the absence of conflict and a sense of inner tranquility. It extends to both personal peace (inner well-being and rest) and relational peace (harmony between individuals or groups). In the New Testament, "eirēnē" often describes the peace that comes from God, reconciling believers to Himself through Christ and fostering harmonious relationships among His people.


## Verses 3-5
**Verse 3**
*Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,*

### **Blessed be God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**
> **Col 1:3-5** *We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,* 
> 4 *since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints;*
> 5 *because of the hope reserved for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel*
>
> **Eph 1:3** *Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ*
>
> **2Cor 1:3** *Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort*
>
> Notice Paul and Peter state the same phrase regarding God the Father, could it be coming from the same Spirit?
>
>**1 Cor 15:24-28** *then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to our God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power. For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet. The last enemy that will be abolished is death. For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is clear that this excludes the Father who put all things in subjection to Him. When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.*

### **His great mercy has caused us to be born again**

> Mercy = the Greek word for mercy is ἔλεος (eleos). This word conveys a sense of compassion and kindness, often referring to God's merciful actions toward humanity. It highlights God's willingness to forgive and show kindness to those in need of His grace.
>
>Kindness is an ingredient of mercy and it is also part of the redemption process. 

>**Romans 2:4** *"Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?"*
>
>**2 Cor 7:9-10** *I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point of repentance; for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything through us. For the sorrow that is according to the will of God produces a repentance without regret, leading to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.*
>
>**John 3:1-3** *Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; this man came to Jesus at night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.” Jesus responded and said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”*
>
>**John 3:4-6** *Nicodemus *said to Him, “How can a person be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born, can he?” Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which has been born of the flesh is flesh, and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it is coming from and where it is going; so is everyone who has been born of the Spirit.”*
>
The Born-Again subject comes up in vs 23 so we will explore that in more detail there.

### **to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead**

>**1 Corinthians 15:12-22** *"Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your faith also is vain. Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised; and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied. But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep. For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive."*

When combined, ζῶσαν ἐλπίδα (zōsan elpida) or "living hope" refers to a dynamic and active expectation of future blessings. This hope is not dead or passive but is alive and continually sustaining believers.

**Verse 4**
*to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,*
### **to obtain an inheritance, reserved in heaven**

>**Ephesians 1:11-19** *In Him we also have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His will, to the end that we who were the first to hope in the Christ would be to the praise of His glory. In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of the promise, who is a first installment of our inheritance, in regard to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory.  15For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints, 16do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers; 17that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. 18I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 19and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe.*
>
>**Acts 26:15-18** *And I said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness not only to the things which you have seen, but also to the things in which I will appear to you; rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you, to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the dominion of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me.’*

**Verse 5**
*who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.*

### protected by the power of God
>This phrase emphasizes that believers are kept safe by God's omnipotent power. The word "protected" comes from the Greek word φρουρέω (phroureō), which means to guard or keep under watch, as a military garrison would guard a city.
>
### through faith
>Faith is the means by which believers experience and participate in God's protection. While God is the one who protects, faith is the channel through which this protection is realized. Faith here implies ongoing trust and reliance on God.
### salvation ready to be revealed in the last time
>The "salvation" referred to here is not just the initial act of being saved (justification) but the full and final deliverance that will be revealed at the end of time (glorification). This is the ultimate completion of God’s saving work, including the resurrection of the body and the full experience of eternal life.

1 Peter 1:5 is part of Peter's broader encouragement to believers who were facing persecution and trials. Peter reminds them that their hope is not in present circumstances but in the future salvation that God has promised. This salvation is secure because it is guarded by God's power, and believers participate in this security through their faith.

## Summary of 1 Peter 1:1-5

1. **Chosen by God (1 Peter 1:1-2)**:
   - **God’s Foreknowledge**: Peter opens by addressing the believers as "elect exiles," chosen by God according to His foreknowledge. This isn't merely God knowing in advance who would choose Him; rather, it speaks to God’s intentional and loving choice to set His affection on them before the world began. This choice is not based on human merit but on God’s sovereign grace.
   - **Sanctification by the Spirit**: The Holy Spirit’s work begins in the life of the believer even before they are aware of it, setting them apart for God’s purposes. The Spirit continues this sanctifying work throughout the believer’s life, transforming them into the likeness of Christ.
   - **Sprinkling with the Blood of Jesus**: The reference to "sprinkling" alludes to the Old Testament sacrificial system, where blood was sprinkled for the cleansing of sin (Exodus 24:8). In the New Testament, this is fulfilled in Jesus’ sacrificial death, where His blood cleanses believers from all sin, establishing a new covenant with them.

2. **Grace and Peace from the Trinity (1 Peter 1:2)**:
   - **Trinitarian Blessing**: Peter’s greeting of "grace and peace" is not just a formality but a declaration of the ongoing experience of the believer. Grace refers to the unmerited favor of God that sustains and empowers them, while peace is the resulting state of wholeness and reconciliation with God. Both are gifts from the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, continuously provided to believers.

3. **New Birth to a Living Hope (1 Peter 1:3)**:
   - **Regeneration**: Peter praises God for the new birth that believers have received through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This new birth isn't just a fresh start; it’s a spiritual transformation that gives believers a living hope. Unlike worldly hopes that are uncertain, this living hope is vibrant and assured, grounded in the reality of Christ’s resurrection.
   - **Inheritance**: The "inheritance" that believers are born into is described as imperishable, undefiled, and unfading—terms that emphasize its eternal and unchanging nature. This inheritance is kept in heaven, secure and untouchable by any earthly power or decay.

4. **Divine Protection (1 Peter 1:4-5)**:
   - **God’s Power**: Peter reassures believers that their salvation is secure because it is "protected by the power of God." This protection isn’t passive; it is an active guarding by God Himself, ensuring that nothing can separate believers from their promised inheritance.
   - **Role of Faith**: This protection is experienced "through faith," highlighting the necessity of ongoing trust in God. Faith is the means by which believers lay hold of God’s promises, even as they navigate the trials and challenges of this life.
   - **Future Revelation**: The ultimate fulfillment of this salvation is "ready to be revealed in the last time." This points to the future when Christ returns and the full glory of salvation is unveiled. The believer’s current experience is just the beginning; the best is yet to come.

## Comprehensive Summary Statement of 1 Peter 1:1-5

These first five verses of 1 Peter encapsulate the entire Christian journey, from divine election to final glorification. **Peter begins by affirming that believers were chosen by God before the foundation of the world, a choice rooted in God’s sovereign foreknowledge and love. This divine election is followed by the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit, setting believers apart and cleansing them through the sacrificial blood of Jesus Christ. Peter then blesses them with grace and peace, gifts from the entire Trinity that sustain the believer’s life. He praises God for the new birth they have received, a spiritual regeneration that grants them a living hope rooted in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This hope leads to an inheritance that is eternal, unchanging, and securely kept in heaven. Throughout their earthly journey, believers are protected by God’s power, their faith serving as the means by which they hold onto this salvation. The culmination of this salvation is yet to be fully revealed, promising a future of glorification and eternal joy in the presence of God.**

In essence, 1 Peter 1:1-5 outlines the narrative of the Christian life, highlighting the interplay of God’s sovereign choice, the work of the Trinity in salvation, the assurance of an eternal inheritance, and the hope of future glorification. It assures believers that their journey is secure, from God’s eternal plan to its ultimate fulfillment in the revelation of Christ.

## **Verses 6-9**
*In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.*
