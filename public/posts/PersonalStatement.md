# Personal Statement of Faith

## The Chief End of Man

I believe that the chief end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. As Scripture declares, *"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God"* **(1 Corinthians 10:31)**. God has designed humanity to find true satisfaction in Him alone, for *"He has satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul He has filled with what is good"* **(Psalm 107:9)**. In God’s presence, we find *"fullness of joy; in His right hand there are pleasures forever"* **(Psalm 16:11)**.

God's Word teaches that life’s ultimate purpose is to fear Him and obey His commandments: *"The conclusion, when all has been heard, is: fear God and keep His commandments, because this applies to every person"* **(Ecclesiastes 12:13)**. Our hearts are meant to desire God above all else, as the psalmist proclaims: *"Whom have I in heaven but You? And besides You, I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever"* **(Psalm 73:25-26)**.

## The Bible
I believe that the Bible is God’s written revelation to humanity, consisting of the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments. It is *"inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work"* **(2 Timothy 3:16-17)**. These Scriptures, being *"spoken from God as men were moved by the Holy Spirit"* **(2 Peter 1:21)**, are inerrant, infallible, and immutable in their original form, serving as the perfect and authoritative guide for faith and practice.

God's Word endures forever, for *"until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until all is accomplished"* **(Matthew 5:18)**. It is "truth," as Jesus prayed, *"Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth"* **(John 17:17)**. The Bible is to be interpreted literally and contextually, recognizing its historical and grammatical context, such as *"God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day"* **(Genesis 1:31)**.

While there is but one true interpretation of each passage, there are many applications that flow from that interpretation. Believers are called to discern the true meaning of Scripture, guided by the Holy Spirit, so that they may *"prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect"* **(Romans 12:2)**.

## The Nature of God
I believe that God is eternal, infinite, and unchanging, existing as one essence in three distinct persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. *"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God"* **(Psalm 90:2)**. He is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient, possessing all power and knowledge, and *"His sovereignty rules over all"* **(Psalm 103:19)**. God is perfectly holy and just, *"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory"* **(Isaiah 6:3)**, and His judgments are always righteous.

God is also good, the source of all that is good, as it is written, *"Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!"* **(Psalm 34:8)**. He is self-existent, declaring, *"I AM WHO I AM"* **(Exodus 3:14)**, having no beginning or end, and *"His throne is established in the heavens"* **(Psalm 103:19)**.

---

### The Nature of God: Attributes of God
**Eternal**: God exists outside of time, without beginning or end.  
*"Before the mountains were born or You gave birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God."* **(Psalm 90:2)**

**Infinite**: God is limitless in His presence, knowledge, and power, filling all things.  
*"Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I do not see him? declares the Lord. Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?"* **(Jeremiah 23:24)**

**Immutable**: God is unchanging in His nature, character, and promises.  
*"For I, the Lord, do not change."* **(Malachi 3:6)**

**Omnipotent**: I believe that God is sovereign over all creation, doing whatever He pleases in heaven, earth, and the seas. *'For I know that the Lord is great and that our Lord is above all gods. Whatever the Lord pleases, He does, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.'* **(Psalm 135:5-6)**

**Omnipresent**: God is present everywhere, and there is no place where He is not.  
*"Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"* **(Psalm 139:7-10)**

**Omniscient**: God knows all things, past, present, and future.  
*"I am God, and there is no one like Me, declaring the end from the beginning."* **(Isaiah 46:9-10)**

**Holy**: God is absolutely pure, set apart from sin, and perfectly righteous.  
*"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory."* (Isaiah 6:3)

**Just**: God's ways are always right and fair; He is the standard of justice.  
*"The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are just."* **(Deuteronomy 32:4)**

**Good**: God is the source of all goodness, and He acts with kindness and mercy.  
*"Taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!"* **(Psalm 34:8)**

**Sovereign**: God exercises supreme authority over all creation.  
*"The Lord has established His throne in the heavens, and His sovereignty rules over all."* **(Psalm 103:19)**

**Self-existent**: God exists by His own power and is dependent on nothing else.  
*"I AM WHO I AM."* **(Exodus 3:14)**

---

### **The Nature of God: The Trinity**

I believe in one God who exists eternally in three distinct persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. *"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!"* **(Deuteronomy 6:4)**. Each person of the Trinity is fully God, sharing the same divine essence and nature, yet they are distinct in person and role. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are co-equal in all their attributes, including holiness, justice, and mercy, and together they reveal the fullness of God's perfect character.

The Scriptures present the unity and distinctiveness of the three persons. Jesus commanded His followers to *"baptize in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,"* **(Matthew 28:19)**, affirming the threefold nature of God. The heavenly vision in Revelation proclaims, *"Holy, Holy, Holy,"* reflecting the holiness of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and *"the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,"* is a benediction highlighting their relational unity **(2 Corinthians 13:14)**.

Though they are distinct in person, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are united in will and purpose. *"There are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one."* **(1 John 5:7)**. Together, they operate in perfect harmony, fulfilling the divine plan in creation, redemption, and sanctification.

---

### **Scriptural Basis for the Trinity**:

- **One God**: The oneness of God is foundational, affirming that there is only one divine being.  
  *"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord is one!"* **(Deuteronomy 6:4)**

- **Three Persons**: The distinct persons of the Godhead are revealed in Jesus' command to baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  
  *"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit."* **(Matthew 28:19)**

- **Unity in Essence**: Though distinct in person, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit share the same divine nature.  
  *"For there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one."* **(1 John 5:7)***

- **Distinct Persons in Relationship**: Each person of the Trinity is involved in a relationship with believers and with one another, as expressed in the apostolic benediction.  
  *"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all."* **(2 Corinthians 13:14)**

---

### **The Holiness of the Trinity**

The holiness of God is central to His nature, and each person of the Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—is perfectly holy, set apart in absolute purity and moral perfection. In the heavenly visions of Scripture, God is worshiped with the thrice-repeated acclamation, *"Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come."* **(Revelation 4:8)**. This threefold declaration emphasizes the infinite holiness of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, affirming their co-equality in divine holiness. The triune God is the source and standard of all that is holy, entirely distinct from creation and without any imperfection.

God’s holiness is reflected individually in each person of the Trinity, revealing the fullness of His pure and righteous character. The Father’s holiness is seen in His utter separation from evil, the Son's holiness is demonstrated through His sinless life and sacrificial atonement, and the Holy Spirit’s holiness is evident in His sanctifying work in believers.

---

### **Scriptural Support for the Holiness of Each Person**:

- **The Holiness of the Father**:  
  God's holiness is manifested in His perfect separation from sin and inability to approve evil.  
  *"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor."* **(Habakkuk 1:13)**  

- **The Holiness of the Son**:  
  Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, was without blemish or spot, living a sinless life to redeem humanity.  
  *"But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."* **(1 Peter 1:19)**  

- **The Holiness of the Holy Spirit**:  
  The Holy Spirit dwells within believers, sanctifying them and making them holy, as the temple of God.  
  *"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? ... For the temple of God is holy, and that is what you are."* **(1 Corinthians 3:16-17)**  

---

### The Nature of God: God the Father
God the Father, the first person of the Trinity, is the sovereign Creator of all things. *"For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and we exist for Him."* **(1 Corinthians 8:6)**. He ordains all things according to His will and purpose, exercising authority over all creation, providence, and redemption. His fatherhood is twofold: He is the Creator and Father of all humanity, **"one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all."** **(Ephesians 4:6)**, but He is the spiritual Father only to those who are in Christ, having adopted them into His family through faith, *"For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."* **(Romans 8:14)**.

God the Father has decreed all things for His glory and continually upholds and governs all creatures and events, *"Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power… indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth."* **(1 Chronicles 29:11)**. In His holiness, He neither authors nor approves of sin, *"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil."* **(Habakkuk 1:13)**, and He preserves the moral accountability of His creation. From eternity past, He graciously chose those whom He would adopt as His children, *"to the praise of the glory of His grace."* **(Ephesians 1:6)**, blessing them with every spiritual blessing in Christ, *"just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him."* **(Ephesians 1:4)**.

---

### The Nature of God: God the Son
I believe that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, is fully God and fully man, possessing two distinct natures in one person. He is the eternal Son of God, *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"* **(John 1:1)**. *Through Him, all things were created, and He is the radiance of God’s glory, "upholding all things by the word of His power"* **(Hebrews 1:3)*.

Jesus was born of a virgin (Matthew 1:23), lived a sinless life, and fulfilled the Law perfectly. He willingly went to the cross, *"bearing our sins in His body on the tree"* **(1 Peter 2:24)**, and died as a substitutionary atonement for humanity’s sins. He rose bodily from the dead on the third day, *"according to the Scriptures"* **(1 Corinthians 15:3-4)**, *conquering sin and death, and ascended into heaven, where He is seated at the right hand of the Father* **(Hebrews 1:3)**.

Christ will return to judge the living and the dead, establishing His eternal kingdom, *"for He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet"* **(1 Corinthians 15:25)**.

#### Key Roles and Attributes of God the Son:
- **Eternal Sonship: Jesus is eternally God, distinct in person, but equal in essence with the Father.**  
*"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." (John 1:1)*

- **Creator and Sustainer: All things were created through Him and for Him.**  
*"For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible." (Colossians 1:16)*

- **Incarnate Savior: Jesus took on human nature, being born of a virgin, and lived a sinless life.**  
*"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory." (John 1:14)*

- **Atoning Sacrifice: He died for our sins, taking the penalty we deserved.**
*"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8)*

- **Resurrected Lord: Jesus rose from the dead, proving His victory over sin and death.**  
*"He is not here, for He has risen, just as He said." (Matthew 28:6)*

- **Exalted King: He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.**  
*"He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high." (Hebrews 1:3)*

### The Nature of God: God the Holy Spirit
I believe that the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is fully God, co-equal with the Father and the Son. The Holy Spirit was active in creation, "moving over the surface of the waters" (Genesis 1:2), and is now the divine agent in regeneration and sanctification. He convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment (John 16:8) and indwells every believer, sealing them for the day of redemption (Ephesians 1:13-14).

The Holy Spirit empowers believers for service, imparts spiritual gifts, and produces the fruit of the Spirit in their lives. He leads and guides believers into all truth, "for He will guide you into all the truth" (John 16:13), and illuminates the Word of God, enabling its application.

#### Key Roles and Attributes of God the Holy Spirit:
- **Divine Person: The Holy Spirit is fully God and co-equal with the Father and Son.**  
*"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." (2 Corinthians 3:17)*

- **Agent of Creation: He was involved in the creation of the world.**  
*"The Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters." (Genesis 1:2)*

- **Convictor of Sin: The Holy Spirit brings conviction of sin, righteousness, and judgment.**  
*"And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment." (John 16:8)*

- **Indwelling Presence: He resides in all believers, empowering them to live godly lives.**  
*"Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" (1 Corinthians 3:16)*

- **Guide to Truth: He leads believers into understanding and applying God's Word.**  
*"But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all the truth." (John 16:13)*

- **Giver of Spiritual Gifts: The Spirit distributes spiritual gifts for the edification of the Church.**  
*"But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills." (1 Corinthians 12:11)*

---

### **What I Believe About the Works of God**

I believe that God the Father is actively involved in His creation through His sovereign works. These works include creation, providence, redemption, and judgment, all of which display His power, wisdom, and goodness. 

- **Creation**: God spoke the universe into existence, *"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"* (Genesis 1:1), and made all things visible and invisible by His Word (Colossians 1:16). He continues to uphold and sustain all creation, *"upholding all things by the word of His power"* (Hebrews 1:3).

- **Providence**: I believe that God not only created all things but continues to sustain and govern the universe by His sovereign will. *'He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; Who makes lightnings for the rain, Who brings forth the wind from His treasuries.'* **(Psalm 135:7)**

- **Redemption**: In His love, the Father sent His Son to accomplish the work of salvation for humanity, *"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son"* (John 3:16). This redemptive work unfolds in history as God calls people to Himself, forgives sins, and adopts believers as His children.

- **Judgment**: God has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness through Jesus Christ, *"He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed"* (Acts 17:31). His works of judgment reveal His holiness and justice.

- **Adoption and Answering Prayers**: God graciously adopts believers into His family, *"You have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, 'Abba! Father!'"* (Romans 8:15), and listens to the prayers of His people, answering according to His will (1 John 5:14).

---

### **The Decrees of God**

I believe that the **Decrees of God** are His eternal ordinances, established in His perfect wisdom and will, by which He determined to accomplish His purposes. These decrees are absolute, sovereign, and unchangeable, encompassing all that will ever happen.

- **Eternal and Unchangeable Plan**: From eternity, God has had a plan that does not change, set forth before the foundation of the world.  
  *"He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world."* (Ephesians 1:4)  
  *"God, who has saved us and called us with a holy calling... according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity."* (2 Timothy 1:9)  

- **Comprehensive Determination of All Things**: God comprehends and determines all events that come to pass, working all things according to His sovereign will.  
  *"He works all things after the counsel of His will."* (Ephesians 1:11)  
  *"The king's heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord; He turns it wherever He wishes."* (Proverbs 21:1)  

- **God’s Relationship to Sin**: Although God decrees all things, He is not the author of sin and does not commit evil. God permits sin but always superintends it for His purposes, bringing about His perfect plan.  
  *"This Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men."* (Acts 2:23)  
  *"The Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.'"* (Job 1:12)  

- **Sovereignty and Unconditional Nature**: God's decrees are unconditional, independent of human action, and established by His sovereign will.  
  *"He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will."* (Ephesians 1:5)  
  *"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven."* (Daniel 4:35)  

- **Inevitability and Efficacy of God's Will**:  The decrees of God are by His sovereign will, and nothing can hinder them. *'Whatever the Lord pleases, He does, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps.'* **(Psalm 135:6)**  
  *"For who can resist His will?"* (Romans 9:19)  
  *"My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose."* (Isaiah 46:10, ESV)
 

- **Consistency with God's Holy Nature**: God's decrees are always perfectly consistent with His holy character. He remains pure and righteous in all His plans.  
  *"Your eyes are too pure to approve evil, and You cannot look on wickedness with favor."* (Habakkuk 1:13)  

---

### **What I Believe About Angels**

I believe that angels are spiritual beings created by God to serve as His messengers and to accomplish His will. The term "angel" means "messenger," and while it may refer to other functions, it primarily describes their role in delivering God's messages or worshiping Him. *"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?"* **(Hebrews 1:14)**. Angels were created at a specific time by God, before the creation of humanity, to reflect His glory. *"For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible."* **(Colossians 1:16)**. They are not eternal like God but exist as immortal beings. *"For they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection."* **(Luke 20:36)**.

Angels were created in great numbers and existed before the foundation of the world, rejoicing at the creation of the earth. *"When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy."* **(Job 38:7)**. They are a higher order of beings than humans, possessing greater strength and knowledge. *"What is man that You take thought of him? Yet You have made him a little lower than the angels."* **(Psalm 8:4-5)**. Angels are often referred to as the "Host of Heaven," symbolizing their role in God's heavenly army. *"I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing on His right and on His left."* **(2 Chronicles 18:18)**.

### **Roles and Classes of Angels**

- **Michael the Archangel** is a warrior angel who defends God's people.  
  *"But Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil..."* **(Jude 1:9)**.
- **Gabriel** is a messenger angel, delivering significant announcements.  
  *"I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news."* **(Luke 1:19)**.
- **Seraphim** worship God and guard His throne.  
  *"Seraphim stood above Him, each having six wings... and one called out to another and said, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts.'"* **(Isaiah 6:2-3)**.
- **Cherubim** guard sacred places, such as the Garden of Eden.  
  *"So He drove the man out; and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim."* **(Genesis 3:24)**.

### **Destiny of Angels**

Angels will live eternally, either in God's presence or, for the fallen angels, in the Lake of Fire. *"Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels."* **(Matthew 25:41)**.

---

### **What I Believe About Satan**

I believe that Satan is a real and personal being, a fallen angel who opposes God and His purposes. He is described as *"a murderer from the beginning... and the father of lies."* **(John 8:44)**. Satan's name means "adversary," reflecting his role in opposing God's work, while other titles, such as "the devil" (slanderer) and "Beelzebub" (lord of the flies), emphasize his malicious nature.

### **Satan's Origin and Fall**

Satan was originally created as a beautiful and powerful angel, endowed with wisdom and splendor. *"You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty."* **(Ezekiel 28:12-13)**. However, pride led to his rebellion, as he sought to elevate himself above God. *"Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor."* **(Ezekiel 28:17)**. He led a rebellion in heaven, deceiving a third of the angels to join him, who then became his demons. *"His tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth."* **(Revelation 12:4)**.

### **Satan's Power and Limitations**

Though Satan possesses significant power, he is not omnipotent, omnipresent, or omniscient. His abilities are limited by God's sovereign control. *"The Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your power, only do not put forth your hand on him.'"* **(Job 1:12)**. Believers can resist Satan by submitting to God. *"Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you."* **(James 4:7)**.

### **The Evil Angels – Demons**

Demons are fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion. They can influence the minds of people, deceive nations, and cause harm. *"The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving."* **(2 Corinthians 4:4)**. Despite their power, demons and Satan are ultimately subject to Christ's authority.

### **The Defeat of Satan**

Satan's defeat was accomplished through Christ's death and resurrection. *"The ruler of this world has been judged."* **(John 16:11)**. His final destiny is the Lake of Fire, where he and his demons will suffer forever. *"And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone."* **(Revelation 20:10)**.

---

### **What I Believe About the Nature of Man**

I believe that humanity was created uniquely by God in His image, known as the **Imago Dei**. *"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky.'"* **(Genesis 1:26-27)**. This image is not a literal or exact representation but reflects God's attributes in a finite and limited way. Humans were created with the capacity for knowledge, righteousness, and holiness, and given the responsibility to exercise dominion over creation. *"What is man that You take thought of him, and the son of man that You care for him? Yet You have made him a little lower than the angels, and You crown him with glory and majesty!"* **(Psalm 8:4-5)**.

Though created in God's likeness, this image has been marred by sin but not destroyed. The **Imago Dei** encompasses intellectual, spiritual, moral, and social aspects of our nature. *"Put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth."* **(Ephesians 4:24)**. *"Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices, and have put on the new self who is being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him."* **(Colossians 3:9-10)**.

In our original state, Adam and Eve were without sin and enjoyed a perfect relationship with God. *"Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."* **(Genesis 2:7)**. *"So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place."* **(Genesis 2:21-22)**. Man's nature consisted of both a physical body and an immaterial soul or spirit, with some theologians suggesting a trichotomous nature. *"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."* **(1 Thessalonians 5:23)**.

However, through the Fall, humanity's moral and spiritual likeness to God has been corrupted, resulting in the universal sinfulness of all people. *"For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."* **(Romans 3:23)**. Yet, through Christ, the image of God is being restored in believers, and it will be perfected at His return. *"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit."* **(2 Corinthians 3:18)**. *"Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly."* **(1 Corinthians 15:49)**.

---

### **What I Believe About Sin**

I believe that **sin** is any failure to conform to the moral law of God, in action, attitude, or nature. Sin originated with Satan's rebellion against God and entered the human race through Adam's disobedience in the Garden of Eden. *"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned."* **(Romans 5:12). Sin separates humanity from God, corrupting the **image of God** in us, and results in both physical and spiritual death. *"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."* (Romans 6:23).

### **The Origin and Nature of Sin**

- **The Origin of Sin**:  
  Sin began with Satan's rebellion against God and subsequently entered the human race through Adam and Eve's disobedience.  
  *"You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created until unrighteousness was found in you."* (Ezekiel 28:15)  
  *"When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes... she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."* (Genesis 3:6)

- **Inherited Sin**:  
  As descendants of Adam, all people inherit a sinful nature, which inclines them toward sin from birth.  
  *"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me."* (Psalm 51:5)  
  *"There is none righteous, not even one."* (Romans 3:10)

- **Total Depravity**:  
  Human nature is corrupted by sin in every aspect—mind, will, and emotions—rendering humanity incapable of pleasing God without His grace.  
  *"The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?"* (Jeremiah 17:9)  
  *"Those who are in the flesh cannot please God."* (Romans 8:8)

### **The Consequences of Sin**

- **Separation from God**:  
  Sin results in spiritual separation from God, disrupting the relationship that humanity was created to enjoy with Him.  
  *"But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you."* (Isaiah 59:2)

- **Physical and Spiritual Death**:  
  Sin brings both physical death and eternal spiritual death, which is separation from God's presence in hell.  
  *"For the wages of sin is death."* (Romans 6:23)  
  *"These will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord."* (2 Thessalonians 1:9)

- **Corruption of Creation**:  
  The effects of sin extend beyond humanity, impacting all of creation, which now suffers under a curse.  
  *"For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope."* (Romans 8:20)

### **The Different Types of Sin**

- **Original Sin**:  
  This refers to the sinful nature inherited from Adam, which corrupts every person at birth.  
  *"Through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men."* (Romans 5:12)

- **Personal Sin**:  
  Individual acts of transgression committed by each person, for which they are accountable.  
  *"If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us."* (1 John 1:8)

- **Sins of Commission and Omission**:  
  Sins of commission are deliberate acts of disobedience, while sins of omission occur when one fails to do what is right.  
  *"Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin."* (James 4:17)

### **God’s Provision for Sin**

- **Atonement Through Christ**:  
  God provided the remedy for sin through the sacrificial death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. His blood covers the sins of all who believe in Him.  
  *"He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness."* (1 Peter 2:24)

- **Confession and Forgiveness**:  
  Believers are called to confess their sins and seek God's forgiveness, which is freely given in Christ.  
  *"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."* (1 John 1:9)

- **Restoration of the Image of God**:  
  Through salvation in Christ, the image of God, which was marred by sin, is progressively restored in believers.  
  *"We all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory."* (2 Corinthians 3:18)

### **Victory Over Sin**

- **Freedom from Sin’s Dominion**:  
  Believers are no longer slaves to sin but are empowered to live in righteousness through the Holy Spirit.  
  *"For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace."* (Romans 6:14)

- **Ongoing Sanctification**:  
  Though the believer is declared righteous in Christ, the process of sanctification continues throughout life as God conforms us to the image of His Son.  
  *"For this is the will of God, your sanctification."* (1 Thessalonians 4:3)

### **Creation**
I believe that God created the universe out of nothing by His word in **six literal days**, as described in Genesis. Jesus Christ, the Creator, brought all things into existence, and everything reflects His sovereign design. Creation glorifies God and reveals His power.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Genesis 1:1* – "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."
  - *John 1:3* – "All things came into being through Him."
  - *Colossians 1:16-17* – "For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth."

### **Providence**
I believe in the **providence of God**, whereby He governs all events, both big and small, according to His eternal plan. Even though I am responsible for my actions, God's providential care directs my path. Even the dust particles in the sunlight move according to His sovereign will.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Psalm 139:7-10* – "Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?"
  - *Proverbs 16:9* – "The mind of man plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps."

---

### **Salvation**
I believe that "Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone, to the glory of God alone"
- **Scripture References**:
  - *Ephesians 2:8-9* – "For by grace you have been saved through faith."
  - *Titus 3:5* – "He saved us... according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration."
  - *Romans 5:1* – "Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God."

### **Salvation**
Salvation is a gift of **God's grace** through faith in **Jesus Christ alone**. It is not based on human works but on the redemptive work of Christ. Believers are justified by faith and adopted as children of God.
- **Key Scriptures**: Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:23-24; John 3:16

### **Eschatology (End Times)**
I believe in a **pre-tribulation rapture**, a **literal seven-year tribulation**, followed by Christ’s **1,000-year reign** on earth. These events will culminate in the final judgment and the new heaven and new earth, where believers will dwell with God forever.
- **Scripture References**:
  - *1 Thessalonians 4:16-17* – "The dead in Christ will rise first... we who are alive will be caught up."
  - *Revelation 20:1-3* – "And He laid hold of the dragon... and bound him for a thousand years."
  - *Revelation 6-19* – Describes the seven-year tribulation.
