# Laodicea the 7th church of the book of Revelation
## The 7th or last period of the Church age

### Two Rules of interpretation
- The Golden Rule: When the plain sense of the text makes common sense, seek no other sense.
- Symbols will always be interpreted by Scripture itself. You never have to guess.

If the symbol has significance, then the meaning will already be established.
It will be in immediate context or soon after, but clearly identified. (see Rev 1:13 and 16. ex. vs20)

You will also find parables in Luke and other synoptic gospels explained to the disciples privately

### Interpreting the Letters
- Literal: Specific, historical
- Universal: General, timeless
- Prophetic: Symbolic, eschatologic

_Rev. 1:19 'Therefore write the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will take place after these things. '
Tells us that everything in this book (letter) is prophetic in nature, including the letters to the churches, thus we have to interpret them as such._

### General observations of the 7 letters
#### These letters in their order form a chiasim
(several passages in the Old and New testament have a chiastic structure to them, it was popular Jewish style of writing)
- 1 - 7 are in great danger
- 2 - 6 are in excellent shape - persecuted
- 3,4,5 middling neither very good or bad

#### Universal Church
The conditions of the original 7 churches describe the condition of local churches now and over the course of 2000 yrs.  Application is meant for the churches, and also to individuals.
Those that repent individually and turn back to their first love will be the overcomers listed.  These church condemnations do not in any way reflect the standings of the saints before God.
We are saved not of works, it is a gift of God.

#### Prophetic Church
Through the 7 periods of the church age, you will see distinct characteristics of each period begin and end.  God will do what He says He will do, and it is evident if you have eyes to see and ears to hear.

## Laodicea Church Interpretation
- 14 “To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: The Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the  Origin of the creation of God, says this:
- 15 ‘I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.
- 16 So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of My mouth.
- 17 Because you say, “I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have no need of anything,” and you do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked,
- 18 I advise you to buy from Me gold refined by fire so that you may become rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness will not be revealed; and eye salve to apply to your eyes so that you may see.
- 19 Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline; therefore be zealous and repent.
- 20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me.
- 21 The one who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.
- 22 The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ ”

### Rev. 3:10 'Because you have kept My word of perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of the testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those who live on the earth. '
Jesus spoke those words to the church of Philadelphia to tell them that they will not take part in the tribulation.  Also this prophetic aspect of these letters were not revealed to the church until about 150 yrs ago.  Allowing God to reveal that we are in the last days, and heed the warning given to the Laodicean church period.

### Church wake up call
The church today is asleep, and lazy.  We say we are rich, but we are so poor spiritually.  I will give a great text for the condition we are in as the impending judgement we will soon face, when our works will be judged.

#### Read Matthew 25

#### The Garden of Gethsemane Matthew 26:36 - 46

### The Laodicean Church
- The descriptors of this church suggests that it is largely unbelievers, (poor, naked, wretched, blind, miserable).  Do a word search and you will see that all those describe an unbeliever. 
- Also notice the description of the saints in Smyrna, they are poor but rich. This church refers to the persecuted church after the 1st century, what does that say about us?  Persecution brings out the true believers, (who wants to be persecuted, if you don't truly believe in what you are being persecuted for?)
- In vs 19. He addresses those whom He loves.  Be zealous and repent, He will grant them to sit with Him on His Throne.  Overcomers.

#### VS. 18 Questions about buy from Me
- 'Buy from Me gold refined by fire' _read Psm 66:10, Prov 17:3, Zech 13:9, Luke 12:21, 1 Tim 6:18, James 1:3-4, 2:5, 1 Peter 1:7, 4:12-13_
- '_Buy from Me_ white garments' Speaks of Righteousness, redeemed, Clothed opposite of naked, we are made righteous. _read Rev 3:4-5, 18, 4:4_
- '_Buy from Me_ Eye salve' speaks of the Word of God that enables us to see life realistically.  Our worldview should be defined by scripture, not the other way around
