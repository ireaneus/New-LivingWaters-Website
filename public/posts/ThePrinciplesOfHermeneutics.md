# THE PRINCIPLES OF HERMENEUTICS

## HOW TO CORRECTLY INTERPRET THE BIBLE

1. SCRIPTURE INTERPRETS SCRIPTURE
Often Scripture interprets itself. In some instances, another Biblical writer interprets another Biblical passage.

1. CONTEXT INTERPRETS SCRIPTURE
The surrounding verses, chapters, and Book of the Bible provide immediate context to any Bible verse, as does the historical, cultural, linguistic context of a verse.

1. INTENT INTERPRETS SCRIPTURE
All Scripture has an intended meaning. It is therefore true that a Scripture has one correct interpretation while it may have many correct applications.

1. THE CLEAR INTERPRETS THE OBSCURE
No verse of Scripture should be interpreted to contradict the overall message of Scripture. When we are faced with an obscure verse, we find a clear verse to help interpret it. â€‹

- Currently more Jews outside the land than inside (2022)
- Parallelism
### Evaluation and Application
- Truths timeless, truth period of time
- Adamic Law code, Abraham - Repeated, discontinued, brand new
- Never "What does this mean to me?" - Rather "What is the H.S. is saying, what is the author intent?
### Correlation
_Harmonize on bible context_ ex. Holy Spirit Gen - Rev
- 8 covenants 5 Jewish
- Law codes
- Who is the text address - Deut / Leviticus 28 promise
- Jews 2Tim - Persecution

## Golden Rule of interpretation
When the plain sense of scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense;
therefore, take every word at its primary ordinary, usual literal meaning
unless the facts of the immediate context, studied in the light of related 
passages and axiomatic and fundamental truths indicate clearly otherwise.
