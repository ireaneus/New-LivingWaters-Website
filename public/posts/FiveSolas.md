The "Five Solas" are five foundational principles of the Protestant Reformation that summarize key theological beliefs. Here they are:

1. **Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone)**:
   
   - This principle asserts that the Bible is the supreme authority in all matters of doctrine and practice. It rejects any source of authority that claims equal standing with the Scriptures.
   - Supporting Verses: 2 Timothy 3:16-17, Acts 17:11.

2. **Sola Fide (Faith Alone)**:
   
   - This doctrine emphasizes that justification is received by faith alone, without the need for good works as a prerequisite. Salvation is a gift from God, accessed through faith in Jesus Christ.
   - Supporting Verses: Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28.

3. **Sola Gratia (Grace Alone)**:
   
   - This principle highlights that salvation comes by God's grace alone, not as something merited by the individual. It is purely the result of God's mercy and favor.
   - Supporting Verses: Ephesians 2:8, Romans 11:6.

4. **Solus Christus (Christ Alone)**:
   
   - This tenet affirms that Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humans. Salvation is obtained through His life, death, and resurrection, with no need for any other intermediaries.
   - Supporting Verses: 1 Timothy 2:5, Acts 4:12.

5. **Soli Deo Gloria (Glory to God Alone)**:
   
   - This principle declares that all glory is due to God alone. It emphasizes that everything in salvation is done for the glory of God, without any human boasting.
   - Supporting Verses: 1 Corinthians 10:31, Romans 11:36.

These principles were central to the teachings of the Reformers and remain essential to many Protestant denominations today.
