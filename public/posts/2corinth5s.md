# Eyes for Eternity

Read from the NASB1995

## James 4:14: 
*"You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away."*

## 2 Corinthians 5:1-10
1. *For we know that if the earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.*
2. *For indeed in this house we groan, longing to be clothed with our dwelling from heaven*
3. *inasmuch as we, having put it on, will not be found naked.* 
4. *For indeed while we are in this tent, we groan, being burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.* 
5. *Now He who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave to us the Spirit as a pledge.*
6. *Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—* 
7. *for we walk by faith, not by sight—*
8. *we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.* 
9. *Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home or absent, to be pleasing to Him.*
10. *For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.*


### Spirit as a pledge
**2 Corinthians 1:21-22**
*"Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God, who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge."*

**Ephesians 1:13-14**
*"In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory."*
