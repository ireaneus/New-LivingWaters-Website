# High Priestly Prayer (Model)

## 3 main points
- Mission
- Men
- Church

### Mission vs. 1-8
1. Prayer to Our Father, followed by in His name - Mature form of prayer Ch.16:26-27
2. Reasoning to God your petition
  a. Rationale to provide why this is a Godly request, Why should I grant this request
vs. 5-8
3. 

### Praying for the Men
1. Within His Will - Reasons for why they are here and who they are.
  a. None will perish, preserve them for their mission
  b. Apostles stayed alive till His word is proclaimed

## The next time you pray
- Make out a list of the requests you desire the Lord to meet
- Then write out 1 or 2 reasons why it would be righteous for God to give you what you seek
- And then incorporate those reasons into your prayers

Instead of just asking God repeatedly with the same words or an extra
“please” in front, ask Him as you would make a case to your boss or
spouse  
- The frst thing you’re bound to due is think more carefully about what you’re asking God for
- You’ll notice when you’re requests are not easy to defend from the perspective of righteousness
- You will probably modify your requests so that they are easier to defend on that basis
- And in those ways, your requests will more quickly come into alignment with the will of God
- And as your requests align with His will, you are going to see your requests answered affirmatively more often
- Also, you’re going to sense yourself growing closer to the Father, as your prayer life becomes less a rigorous, ritualistic enumeration of requests
- And turns into a conversation, rich and deep with purpose
