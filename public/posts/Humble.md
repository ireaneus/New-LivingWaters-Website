# Humble is not a fruit of the Spirit
## 1 Peter 5:5-6
5. *You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.*
6. *Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,* 

Notice vs.6 Therefore, it ties in with vs.5 to conclude the statement of vs.5.  So it is addressing younger men (not yet ready to be elders), submit to the elders of the church, being humble in **Heb. 13:17** Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you. 

So this is not stating a condition all christians must be 24/7, vs.6 has a qualifier to it in vs.5 so it applies to the younger members of the body.

### Humble then exalted
In the New Testament (NASB1995), there are multiple references to humility and commands to be humble. A specific count of instances varies based on how terms like "humility," "humble," and related concepts are interpreted across translations. However, key verses that directly address the need for humility include:

- **Matthew 23:12:** *"Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted."*
- **James 4:10:** *"Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord, and He will exalt you."*
- **1 Peter 5:6:** *"Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time."*
- **Philippians 2:3:** *"Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more important than yourselves."*

Overall, humility is a recurring theme, closely tied to living a Christ-like life, and it's commanded multiple times throughout the New Testament as a vital Christian virtue
