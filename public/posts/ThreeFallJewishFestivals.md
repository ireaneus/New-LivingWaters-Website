In Jewish tradition, the three major fall festivals are Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot. These festivals carry significant religious and cultural meanings, marking a period of introspection, atonement, and celebration.

1. Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year):

* Timing: Celebrated on the first and second days of the Hebrew month of Tishrei.
* Significance: It marks the beginning of the Jewish New Year and is considered the anniversary of the creation of the world. Rosh Hashanah is a time of judgment when God reviews the deeds of all people for the past year.
* Customs:
- Blowing the shofar (ram's horn) to herald the new year and call for spiritual awakening.
- Attending synagogue services with special liturgy.
- Eating symbolic foods like apples dipped in honey to wish for a sweet new year.
1. Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement):

* Timing: Observed on the 10th day of Tishrei, ten days after Rosh Hashanah.
* Significance: It is the holiest day of the Jewish year, dedicated to fasting, prayer, and repentance. Yom Kippur is believed to be the day when God's judgment from Rosh Hashanah is sealed.
* Customs:
- A 25-hour fast from food and drink.
- Refraining from physical pleasures and work.
- Attending extended synagogue services that include the recitation of the Vidui (confession of sins) and the Neilah (closing) service.
- Seeking forgiveness from God and from others.
1. Sukkot (Feast of Tabernacles):

* Timing: Begins on the 15th day of Tishrei, five days after Yom Kippur, and lasts for seven days (in Israel) or eight days (in the Diaspora, with the final day known as Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah).
* Significance: Sukkot commemorates the 40 years of wandering in the desert after the Exodus from Egypt, during which the Israelites lived in temporary shelters (sukkot). It is also a harvest festival celebrating the gathering of the crops.
* Customs:
- Building and dwelling in a sukkah (a temporary hut) to remember the shelters used by the Israelites.
- Waving the lulav (palm branch), etrog (citron), hadas (myrtle), and arava (willow) in a ritual known as the Four Species.
- Joyous celebrations, including festive meals in the sukkah and synagogue services with Hallel (praise) and Hoshanot (prayers for salvation).

These festivals are deeply intertwined, forming a period of reflection, atonement, and rejoicing in the Jewish calendar.
