### John 6:1-7
1. *After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).*
2. *A large crowd followed Him, because they saw the signs which He was performing on those who were sick.*
3. *Then Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples.*
4. *Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.*
5. *Therefore Jesus, lifting up His eyes and seeing that a large crowd was coming to Him, said to Philip, “Where are we to buy bread, so that these may eat?”*
6. *This He was saying to test him, for He Himself knew what He was intending to do.*
7. *Philip answered Him, “ Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, for everyone to receive a little.”*

John, the writer (with God as the author), begins chapter 6 with the phrase "After these things..." and in verse 4, he mentions that "the Passover is near." This indicates that nearly a year has passed since the events of chapter 5.

At the end of Ch. 5 John just finished speaking of Moses, and so in Ch. 6 he begins to illustrate it through the feeding of the 5000.

### John 5:45-47
45. *Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; the one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have put your hope.*
46. *For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about Me.*
47. *But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?”*

Even though this miracle is recorded in all four Gospels, John includes it to connect with an Old Testament truth, laying the groundwork for a deeper revelation of who Christ is.

### Mark 6:31-34
31. *And He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest a little while.” (For there were many people coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.)* 
32. *And they went away in the boat to a secluded place by themselves.*
33. *The people saw them going, and many recognized them and ran there together on foot from all the cities, and got there ahead of them.* 
34. *When Jesus went ashore, He saw a large crowd, and He felt compassion for them because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and He began to teach them many things.*

### Exodus events described with the feeding of 5000
1. Jesus crosses sea
2. To a remote wilderness where there is no means to sustain them
3. Large crowd follows Him 
4. He went up the mountain (crowd below)


## John 6:16-34

## The Origins of Faith
### John 6:35-71
The explanation Jesus provides is absolutely foundational to our
understanding of the Gospel and of grace itself
- vs.37 The Father gives / elects, all will come to Jesus 
- Soteriology - 
1. Decision of the Father - Doctrine of Election
2. The election will come to Christ. Doctrine of irresistable Grace
3. Will not be cast out, those that come (all) Once saved always saved - Doctrine of eternal security

### Romans 8:31-34

### Ephesians 1:3-6
- world conceived in Greek
### Grace defined
### Ephesians 2:8-9
- For BY grace through faith
- Grace comes before faith - Grace delivered to us and through faith (2) 
Bible is instruction for not only sin but who God is

**vs.38-40**
- All will come to Him and will be raised on last day
- several will of God the Father
- Grace Unmerited Favor

**vs.41-42**
- They didn't know Him as Lord God
- Identity of Christ - core of the Gospel

**vs.43-51**
- Corallary Everyone that come from the Father - 
- The word for draw in Greek is helko, which literally means to drag Ch. 21:6 haul, Acts 21:30 dragged.
- We are opposed to the gospel by our nature, Paul was arrested.
Rom. 8:6-8, 1Cor.12:3, 2:14, 1John 4:1-3

- Manna still leads to death came at night
- Ps. 34 sweet
- Manna consumed, Jesus fully consumed 
- Jesus taken once

Then in vs.56-57, Jesus returns to the principles of eternal security and the
Father’s sovereignty in the salvation process
## Model to evangelism Ch. 6 Same message
Resurrection from the dead
**Luke 12:4-5**
**vs.52-59**

**vs.59-65**
- false disciples rejecting the truth of salvation
- vs.64 from the beginning of the foundation
- vs.65 repeats the salvation process
 
 **vs. 66-71**
 - vs.70 review the process He chose them, not of your own making, Lord rebukes Peter
