# Zechariah 12:9-10
_9 And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem._
_10 “I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn._

- Remember the teaching in Nazerath "Today this has been fulfilled in your hearing"
- They didn't realize Isa 61:1-2 that He came and fullfilled the 1st half of vs 2.
## Isa. 61:1-2a
_1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,
Because the LORD has anointed me
To bring good news to the afflicted;
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to captives
And freedom to prisoners;
2 To proclaim the favorable year of the LORD_
- The second halve of vs. 2: "And the Day of vengence of our God" had to wait this is what the Jews of that day and what we have to look forward today

# Zechariah 14
#### God Will Battle Jerusalem’s Foes
  _3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.  4 In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.  5 You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!  6 In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.  7 For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.  8 And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter._

#### God Will Be King over All
  _- 9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one._
