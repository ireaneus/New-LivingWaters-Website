## The Judgement seat of Christ

Last week's sermon centered exclusively on Verse 10 and the theme of being overcomers. This verse, however, also highlights a significant event in the Christian's eternal life: the Bema Seat, or Judgment Seat of Christ.

This round table session will dive into this verse and others as we explore questions about its significance. We aim to uncover the truths and address misconceptions about the Bema Seat and the concept of being overcomers.

### Q.1 What is the Bema, or Judgement Seat?

---
.

---

The word "Bema" (βῆμα) in Greek originally referred to a step or a raised platform. In ancient Greek culture, it was often used to describe the platform where a judge or official would stand to make a public proclamation, render judgments, or give rewards.

**2 Corinthians 5:10** *For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad.*

**1 Corinthians 4:5:** *Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men’s hearts; and then each man’s praise will come to him from God.*

**Romans 14:10** *But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.*

> **Answer:** The Judgement seat is where believers will be evaluated based on their works for the purpose of rewards, not salvation.


### Q.2 What is NOT the Judgement Seat

---

**Romans 8:1-2:**
1. *Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.* 
2. *For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death.*

This moment of judgment is for rewards, merit, recompense, and repayment. We will not be judged for our sins—absolutely not—as they have been fully covered by the sacrifice of Jesus, never to be brought up again (repeat this truth as often as needed!).

> **Answer:** The Bema Seat is not the Great White Throne Judgment (Revelation 20:11-15), and it is not a judgment for sin.


### Q.3 What is the purpose of the Bema Seat

**1 Corinthians 3:12-15:**  
12. *Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,*
13. *each man’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each man’s work.* 
14. *If any man’s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward.* 
15. *If any man’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.*

> **Answer:** The purpose is to assess the deeds of believers to determine rewards, not to judge for salvation, as salvation is already secured in Christ.

## Q.4 How do works relate to the Bema seat judgment?

**1 Corinthians 2:8-10:**
8. *For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;* 
9. *not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.* 
10. *For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.*

**James 2:20-26**
20. *But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?* 
21. *Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?* 
22. *You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;* 
23. *and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God.* 
24. *You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.* 
25. *In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?* 
26. *For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.*

> **Answer:** Works are the basis for the rewards believers receive at the Bema seat, but they do not determine salvation.

### Q.5 How should the understanding of the Bema seat influence a believer's life and actions?

**1 Corinthians 15:58 -** *"Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."*

**James 5:7-9:**  
7. *Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains.* 
8. *You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.* 
9. *Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door.*

**Luke 14:12-14:**  
12. *And He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment.* 
13. *But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,* 
14. *and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you; for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”*

> **Answer:** The Bema Seat serves as a powerful reminder to live with an eternal perspective, focusing on pleasing Christ and investing in what truly matters in His kingdom.


### Revelation 22:12
**“Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has done.**
