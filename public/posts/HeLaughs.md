**Extra Credit:** Psalm 119

## God's Chosen People
### Psalms 2:1-3
*1 Why are the nations in an uproar And the peoples devising a vain thing?*

*2 The kings of the earth take their stand And the rulers take counsel together Against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying,*

*3 "Let us tear their fetters apart And cast away their cords from us!"*

*4 He who sits in the heavens laughs, The Lord scoffs at them.*

**Ripped from the headlines:** *"Arabs are laughing at the Iran attack"*

Psalms 2 context is speaking of time surrounding the Tribulation and the end of it when Christ sets up His Kingdom on earth, but in the Acts verses the church is praying about the persecution they were just a part of and praising God for that persecution.  It is a sign that God was actively involved with His elect. Do you see that He is actively involved with Israel today?

### Luke 21:29-32
*29 Then He told them a parable: "Behold the fig tree and all the trees;*

*30 as soon as they put forth leaves, you see it and know for yourselves that summer is now near.*

*31 "So you also, when you see these things happening, recognize that the kingdom of God is near.*

*32 "Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all things take place.*

*33 "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.*

### This generation will not pass away
In this passage Jesus is talking about the nation of Israel, and as you know Israel as a nation has been scattered since A.D. 70 until 1948.  Many people believe that the "generation" speaks of roughly 70 yrs but that is not really the case, it actually speaks of this generation meaning once this regathering has taken place and the signs that proceeded that (read Luke 21 for context) they will not be re-scattered again. And do you know that since October 2023 (first attack against Israel) there has been a migration movement of Jews back to Israel.


## Speak the Word of God with Boldness
### Acts 4:31
*31 And when they had prayed, the place where they had gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.*


## Application
The Acts Church was praying about the persecution they were encountering, this persecution of Christians has gone on since that "day of Pentecost" till now, we are seeing persecution spilling into Israel now, and just as God has promised in His word, it will not pass away.  So too this generation of Israel will not either.



Now is the time to read God's Word, apply it to your life, speak it boldly.  The time is short, we could be mere hours away from His return for the bride, that's you my christian brothers and sisters! God is waiting for the "Fullness of the Gentiles come in"  If you are speaking the Word boldly you could be speaking to the last one that believes, and up we go! Praise God!



### 1 Thessalonians 4:16-19
*16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.*

*17 Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.*

*18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.*



## Prayer

*Heavenly Father, we recognize the time is short, we pray for your people Israel that you keep them, protect them.  We look forward to your kingdom to be here on earth.  Help us to speak boldly your Word today, so that we may usher in the last believing saint and take us home.  We long to be in your presence and worship you for all eternity.  Thank you for forgiving us our trespasses, and protect us from the evil one. In Jesus name, Amen*
